## 🚀 Super Simple Method (5 Steps!)

### STEP 1: Go to Railway

1. Open: `railway.app`
2. Log in
3. Click: **"handsome-adventure"** project

---

### STEP 2: Click on "riddick-chess" Service

1. **Look for a service** that says **"riddick-chess"**
   - It might be the ONLY service you see - that's fine!
2. **Click on it**

**You should see:** A page with tabs at the top

---

### STEP 3: Click "Deployments" Tab

1. **Look at the top** - you should see tabs
2. **Click "Deployments"** tab

**You should see:** A list of deployments

---

### STEP 4: Click Latest Deployment + Shell

1. **Click on the TOP deployment** (the newest one)
2. **Look for a "Shell" button** and click it
   - It might say "Terminal" or "Console" instead
   - Or look for an icon: `>_` or `$`

**You should see:** A black terminal box appears

---

### STEP 5: Run the Command

1. **Click inside the black terminal box**
2. **Type this** (or copy and paste):
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
   ```
3. **Press Enter**
4. **Wait 10-30 seconds**

**You should see:** Text scrolling, then:
```
✔ Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema
```

**If you see that, YOU'RE DONE!** 🎉

## 🎯 That's It!

You don't need the database service at all! Just use the web service (riddick-chess) and you're good to go!

## 🆘 If You Can't Find "Shell" Button

**Look for:**
- "Terminal" button
- "Console" button  
- "Open Shell" button
- Three dots menu `...` (shell might be inside)
- "View Logs" (shell might be there)

**Or tell me what buttons you DO see and I'll help!**
